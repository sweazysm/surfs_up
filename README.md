# Surfs Up! A ~ Wavy ~ Analysis

## Overview

The Client, W. Avy, is looking for particular trends before opening their Surf Shop. Specifically, W. Avy is looking for temperature trends from the months of June and December (Summer and Winter) for business in Ohau regarding both Surfing and Ice Cream sales. W. Avy wants their business to stay afloat year round, so the task given has been to determine the temperature averages (and more) for the months of June and December so that W. Avy can present these findings to those involved in their business.

- Both months saw temperatures that did not deviate too much from one another in the grand scheme. While one would expect June to be much hotter than December, it can be seen that the max temperature for December was 83(!) and the max temperature for June was 85. In Ohau it seems to be warm year round, which may not necessarily benefit or detur business for ice cream or surfing.

Summers do not seem to get particularly scalding and winters do not seem to get particularly chilly. Ohau seems to have amazing weather when looking at the temperature!
