# Surfs Up! A ~ Wavy ~ Analysis

## Overview

The Client, W. Avy, is looking for particular trends before opening their Surf Shop. Specifically, W. Avy is looking for temperature trends from the months of June and December (Summer and Winter) for business in Ohau regarding both Surfing and Ice Cream sales. W. Avy wants their business to stay afloat year round, so the task given has been to determine the temperature averages (and more) for the months of June and December so that W. Avy can present these findings to those involved in their business.

## Results

The results from the queries conducted were as follows:

- Comparing June and December we see 1517 points of information for December and 1700 points of information for June. Both months had a similar standard deviation, June's STD being 3.25 and December's being 3.74. 

- Both months saw temperatures that did not deviate too much from one another in the grand scheme. While one would expect June to be much hotter than December, it can be seen that the max temperature for December was 83(!) and the max temperature for June was 85. In Ohau it seems to be warm year round, which may not necessarily benefit or detur business for ice cream or surfing.

- Both months had a similar mean temperature, with December's mean temperature being 71.04 and June's mean temperature being 74.94. 

- Perhaps the biggest difference in temperature can be seen in the minimum temperatures observed. For December the minimum temperature observed was 56, while in June the minimum temperature observed was 64. Summers do not seem to get particularly scalding and winters do not seem to get particularly chilly. Ohau seems to have amazing weather when looking at the temperature! When can I move there and what is the job market like?

- While it may seem obvious, while the temperatures are similar it was warmer in June compared to December. All summary statistics are visualized below in a temperature table for both June and December.

## Summary

W. Avy asked if the Surf Shop and Ice Cream business could be sustainable year round. This would bean favorable temperatures for both activities during (at least) a majority of the year. The queries performed on the months of June and December showed very similar temperature trends with over 1000 points of data for each query. From this it can be garnered that consistent temperature will lead to consistent favorable business conditons (in regards to temperature). Other factors such as weather events, business developments, and population activity remain to be seen from the queries performed. 

Additional queries could garner more information to better inform W. Avy on their business idea(s). The recommendations for queries to be performed would be additional queries on weather events such as rain, hail, tornadoes, hurricanes, and other major weather events. If temperature stays consistent throughout the year on Ohau then other factors need to be observed. 

Another queery could be performed on the stations in Ohau, as each of them will have different temperatures for the area. Temperatures fluctuate, even if just a little, across any stretch of area. If one is to make it out on top in business then every advantage needs to be taken into account. Each station could have a query run on it/it's area to determine percepitation, temperatures, and other data information to find out what areas have the best/most ideal conditions year round. Those that bring about the idea of paradise most often would be the best places to set up shop for surfing and a cold scoop of ice cream!
